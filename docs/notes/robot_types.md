# Architecture Decision Record: Robot Types and Behavior

## Context
The system involves multiple types of robots, each with distinct roles and behaviors. These include Exploration Robots, Collection Robots, and Scientific Robots. Each type is designed to fulfill specific tasks within the simulation.

## Decision
We chose to implement distinct robot types to ensure modularity and specialization. Each robot type has unique capabilities and behaviors:

- **Exploration Robots**: Focus on discovering new areas of the map and updating the station's knowledge.
- **Collection Robots**: Specialize in gathering resources like minerals and energy.
- **Scientific Robots**: Analyze science points and contribute to scientific data collection.

## Rationale
- **Modularity**: By separating responsibilities, each robot type can be developed and tested independently.
- **Scalability**: Adding new robot types in the future becomes easier.
- **Efficiency**: Specialized robots can perform their tasks more effectively than a general-purpose robot.

## Consequences
- Increased complexity in managing multiple robot types.
- Requires a robust communication system to coordinate between robots and the station.
