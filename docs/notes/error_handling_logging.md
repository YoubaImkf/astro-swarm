# Architecture Decision Record: Error Handling and Logging

## Context
The system involves multiple components and threads, making error handling and debugging critical.

## Decision
We implemented structured error handling and logging using the `log` crate.

## Rationale
- **Debugging**: Logs provide insights into system behavior and help identify issues.
- **Resilience**: Structured error handling ensures the system can recover from failures.

## Consequences
- Logging can introduce performance overhead if not managed properly.
- Requires consistent use of logging and error handling across the codebase.
