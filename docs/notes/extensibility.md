# Architecture Decision Record: Extensibility

## Context
The system should support adding new robot types, features, or modules in the future.

## Decision
We designed the architecture to be modular and extensible.

## Rationale
- **Modularity**: Separating concerns into distinct modules makes it easier to add new features.
- **Scalability**: The system can grow without significant refactoring.

## Consequences
- Initial development is more complex due to the need for modular design.
- Requires thorough documentation to ensure new developers can extend the system easily.
